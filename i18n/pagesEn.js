    "arText": "Our clients demand the most powerful, professional Augmented Reality that exists. Here at Arvolution, AR isn’t new. It’s the reason we were founded. We have a proven record of creating custom experiences since 2014. Enough time to prove this technology increases engagement, boosts safety, speeds completion of tasks and greatly reduces errors. Our team helps you strategize the perfect approach, and guides your solution every step of the way.",
    "arText2": "The technology works by using aspects of our surroundings such as faces, places, print media or other physical items to trigger digital content which appears to be directly layered over the physical world. This digital content can take the form of CGI interactions, animations, text, imagery, games, videos, voice overs – or a combination of any digital media content.",
    "arText3": "The primary benefit of using AR is that it enables us to visualise and communicate ideas with an enhanced level of visual clarity and interactivity that simply can’t be achieved through any other digital methods. AR experiences can be easily distributed on large scales through convenient and portable devices.",
    "vrText": "We develop Virtual Reality applications and installations for corporate usage and public distribution. We work to create stand out, interactive, immersive content that taps into not only the mind, but also the body. The uses for VR are constantly evolving and we are always seeking out new and innovative ways to harness the technology.",
    "vrText2": "Virtual Reality has the ability to visually transport users to any location or situation in a matter of seconds. The technology enables us to generate digital simulations of 3D environments and images and interact with them in seemingly real ways with the help of special equipment.",
    "vrText3": "Virtual Reality can work as a more creative path for communicating and inspiring audiences. Simulate any desired situation or process and experience it first hand. Create campaigns that interact directly with consumers. Visualise and demonstrate processes and procedures, even on microscopic scales. Preview what a product may look or work like in various environments, sizes, colours, shapes and styles. Possibilities of this technology are endless.",
    "webMobDevelopmentText": "Software is powering almost every business today in some way. Much of this software is custom, bespoke solutions to the unique challenges of a business.
